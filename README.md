Unity projects

Here, I'll be posting Unity projects trying different technologies, experimenting with gameplay and mechanics implementation. 
Basically, this is going to be kind of a sandbox for my own ideas and interests.
My intentions are to make it the most comprehensible, efficient and didactic possible, but having fun!
