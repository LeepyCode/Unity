Unity projects

Here I'll be posting Unity projects trying different techonologies, experimenting with gameplay and mechanichs implementation. 
Basically this is going to be kind of a sandbox for my own ideas and interesets.
My intentions are to make it the most comprehensible, efficient and didactic possible, but having fun!
