Unity projects

Here, I'll be posting Unity projects trying different technologies and experimenting with gameplay and mechanics implementation. 
Basically, this is going to be kind of a sandbox repository for my own ideas and interests.
My intentions are to code in the most comprehensible, efficient and didactic way possible, but having fun!
